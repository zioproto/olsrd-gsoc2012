   PLUGIN USAGE
==================

installation:
make
make install


   PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
==========================

The plugin accepts two parameters: "port" and "accept". There are no
futher parameters.  Here's an example configuration for UNIX systems
(for Windows, change the plugin to end in .dll):

LoadPlugin "olsrd_jsoninfo.so.0.1"
{
    # the default port is 9090 but you can change it like this:
    #PlParam     "port"   "8080"

    # You can set a "accept" single address to allow to connect to
    # jsoninfo. If no address is specified, then localhost (127.0.0.1)
    # is allowed by default.  jsoninfo will only use the first "accept"
    # parameter specified and will ignore the rest.

    # to allow a specific host:
    #PlParam      "accept" "172.29.44.23"
    # if you set it to 0.0.0.0, it will accept all connections
    #PlParam      "accept" "0.0.0.0"
}
