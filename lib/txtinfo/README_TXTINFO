   PLUGIN USAGE
==================

installation:
make
make install

echo /all | nc 127.0.0.1 2006
 or
telnet 127.0.0.1 2006 (and type /all then enter)
 or
wget http://localhost:2006/all -qO -
 or
curl http://localhost:2006/all

Or in a web browser: http://localhost:2006/all

The output shows the links of the node, its neighbors, the topology
table, HNA (Host and Network Association) and MID (Multiple Interface
Declaration) tables and the actual routing table.

So what commands does the txtinfo plugin accept?

    * Config: "/config" -> send_what=SIW_CONFIG
    * Gateways: "/gateway" -> send_what=SIW_GATEWAY
    * HNA: "/hna" -> send_what=SIW_HNA
    * Interfaces: "/interface" -> send_what=SIW_INTERFACE
    * Links: "/link" -> send_what=SIW_LINK
    * MID: "/mid" -> send_what=SIW_MID
    * Neighbors: "/neigh" -> send_what=SIW_NEIGH
    * Routes: "/route" -> send_what=SIW_ROUTE
    * Topology: "/topo" -> send_what=SIW_TOPO
    * 2-hop neighbors: "/2hop" -> send_what=SIW_2HOP

This is the same as the "/neigh" and "/link" commands combined:

    * "/neighbours" -> send_what = SIW_NEIGHLINK -> neighbours and links

Then there is "/all" which returns all of the most commonly used
commands above (but not every command above). "/all" is the same as
"/links/neigh/topo/hna/mid/routes".

   PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
==========================

The plugin accepts two parameters: "port" and "accept". There are no
futher parameters.  Here's an example configuration for UNIX systems
(for Windows, change the plugin to end in .dll):

LoadPlugin "olsrd_txtinfo.so.0.1"
{
    # the default port is 2006 but you can change it like this:
    #PlParam     "port"   "8080"

    # You can set a "accept" single address to allow to connect to
    # txtinfo. If no address is specified, then localhost (127.0.0.1)
    # is allowed by default.  txtinfo will only use the first "accept"
    # parameter specified and will ignore the rest.

    # to allow a specific host:
    #PlParam      "accept" "172.29.44.23"
    # if you set it to 0.0.0.0, it will accept all connections
    #PlParam      "accept" "0.0.0.0"
}
